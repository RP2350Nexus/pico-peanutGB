# General Info

Only binaries for Pico 2 are available. The emulator is too slow on the original Pico or other RP2040 based boards.

- pico2_PicoPeanutGBPimoroniDV.uf2 : For the Pimoroni DV Deno Base with Pico2.
- pico2_PicoPeanutGBAdaFruitDVISD.uf2 : For the breadboard or PCN variant with Pico 2
- pico_nesPCB_v20.zip: PCB Design. For more info see the [Pico-InfonesPlus sister project](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/pico-infonesPlus#pcb-with-raspberry-pi-pico-or-pico-2).

> [!NOTE]
The emulator is still in development and may have performance issues, causing some games to not run at full speed and red screen flicker. It is not cycle accurate, feature-complete, fully tested, or entirely stable. Maybe some games will not run at all.

> [!WARNING]
>  Some games show red flashing between screens. This can be occasionally or severe depending on the game. If you are sensitive for this, or experience health issues while playing those games, please stop playing immediately.
